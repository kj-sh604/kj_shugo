# kj_sh604's Hugo Theme (kj_shugo)

a VERY simple Hugo theme that I use on my [blog](https://aedrielkylejavier.me/articles/) and [scripts/tools](https://aedrielkylejavier.me/scripts-and-tools/) sites.

# features:
* very minimal stylesheet (`/style.css`)
* dark mode and light mode (based on site vistors' system settings)
    * this is done with a simple `<meta>` tag:
        * `<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">`
* responsive for mobile and desktop
